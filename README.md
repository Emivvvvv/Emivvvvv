### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emirhan.

I can write Rust, C, C++ and Python programming languages and I have experience with CosmWasm framework for dApps.

I do have a little experience with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Bash and Linux.

I'm currently learning Haskell and Go programming languages and I'm actively learning RISC-V processor development for Teknofest's microprocessor design competition, gaining expertise in architecture, HDL coding, and optimization techniques.
