### Hi there 👋

My name is Emirhan.

I’m currently in the second grade of my bachelor's and doing an exchange study in the Netherlands. Currently conducting research with a group of 4 with a robot named “Furhat”. Planning to focus on Teknofest’s digital processor design competition after my exchange program.
